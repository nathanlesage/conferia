# Conferia.js

> You can see an [interactive demo](demo/index.htm) to experience Conferia.js.

Conferia.js is a drop-in solution that connects the needs of conference
organizers and participants. For organizers, it aims to make it easy to create
an interactive agenda with little overhead. This is especially crucial since
organizing a conference usually involves many working hours, especially once the
abstracts are accepted and the agenda setting begins. Conferia.js stays out of
the way by only requiring a data file that conference organizers usually need to
create anyhow.

At the same time, Conferia.js makes it easy and straight-forward for
participants to parse and understand the conference schedule. Conferia.js comes
as a full solution for participants to find and filter events, create their own
personal schedule, and even add the events to their own calendar to never miss
an exciting presentation.

This documentation includes three documents:

* [An interactive demo with test data to try the tool out.](demo/index.htm)
* [A comprehensive setup guide for conference organizers.](organizers-guide.md)
* [A user's guide for participants and users of the app.](users-guide.md)

If you spot a bug, please
[create a bug report](https://github.com/nathanlesage/conferia/issues) on GitHub
to make the app better for everyone.
